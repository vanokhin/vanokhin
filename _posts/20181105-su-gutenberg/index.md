Hey dear users!

Today, I released a new version of Shortcodes Ultimate (5.1.0) which introduces support for the new WordPress editor called Gutenberg.

When you install the updated version, the plugin will add the “Insert shortcode” button to the following blocks:

- Paragraph
- Shortcode
- Classic

A quick demo:

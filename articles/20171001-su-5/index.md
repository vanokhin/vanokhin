Many users wondered about a full list of available shortcodes and their settings. Now the full shortcode list divided into groups can be accessed directly from dashboard. I've drawn more than 60 vector icons for this page.

## New project site and documentation

The key change of add-ons is a new automatic update system. Now Kernl.us service provides automatic updates. Besides, some errors have been fixed.

To enable automatic updates you should use a license key. This article explains where to find and how to activate the license key.

Maker add-on, enabling to create custom shortcodes, has been renamed into Shortcode Creator. Besides, it has got a new interface which is quicker and more user-friendly.
